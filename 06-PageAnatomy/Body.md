# Body
The body is the relevant content of a web page, excluding the navigation bar, footer, modal views, etc.

**Be consistent, reuse components.** Apply your design system to the body, just as you would for the other elements.

**Make sure itâ€™s fully responsive.** Like the rest of the components, the body must be totally responsive. Also be careful not to take all the space on the large screens: set a maximum width, and center the body if this value is exceeded.
