# Best practices
Here is a a set of rules that web designers follow, knowing that they align with visitors’ expectations, which we advise you to respect because they have become more or less standards. However, if you feel that it doesn't concern you, you can go through it.

**Logo in the top left.** Most websites have a clickable logo in the left of the navigation bar.

**Contact in top right.** Almost half of the website having a contact forma have a contact button on the right of the navigation bar.

**Slideshow / Carousel in the landing page.** When your users are visiting your site for the first time, you absolutely need to retain their attention. A slideshow can help user understand what you’re doing and what value you bring to them.
