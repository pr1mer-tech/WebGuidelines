# Web design guidelines

Use these guidelines for your website. We have tried to be as broad as possible. To implement these guidelines, we have relied heavily on Apple's Human interface guidelines, Google's advice on [web.dev](https://web.dev) and the WebKit blog. We are not affiliated with any of these resources and this resource is a simple adaptation, which should not be confused in any way.
